Make your WordPress site a little weird by adding a peculiar pointer.

== Description ==
The Peculiar Pointers block is a container block where everything inside that container will display a custom cursor. Just upload your pointer and then fill the container with whatever blocks you want. It's that easy.

#### I need pointers on where to find pointers.
Don't worry, we got you covered. Just head on over to the [WeirdPress cursor collection](https://weirdpress.club/pointers) and see all the weird stuff we have for you.

== Screenshots ==
1. Add your cursor, then your blocks. All done.

== Changelog ==
* 1.0.1 Update "Tested up to" WordPress version.
* 1.0.0 Initial Commit
